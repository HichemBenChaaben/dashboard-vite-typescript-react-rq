# Frontend home assignment

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR.

## Available Scripts

To install `pnpm` run `corepack enable`.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `pnpm dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.

### `pnpm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `pnpm build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.

### `pnpm run server`

Runs the instance of `json-server` mocked REST API.
Once the API running, you'll be able to retrieve the assignment data set in order to focus only on the construction
of the front-end.

You can read more about [available routes for the API here](./server/ROUTES.md)
